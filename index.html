    <p>Below are pictures of my two amazing cats!</p>
    <h2>Mona!</h2>

    <p>Meet Mona! He's a 4 year old tuexdo cat. He is my first cat that I rescued. The story of how I got him was when he was thrown out by a family living in my apartment. My mom saved him from getting hit by a car, so she asked me to take him to the shelter. I fell in love with him and took him home! He is a grumpy cat but when he wants affection, he'll show it! He also likes bread.</p>
    <h2>Nezuko!</h2>

    <p>Meet Nezuko! She's a 4 and half year old tabby cat. She is my second cat that I rescued. I got Nezuko because my mom's downstairs neighbor had thrown her out into the street like her brother Mona. My mom calls again like last time and told me she found this tiny cat when she was walking the dog. I quickly drove over to her location and pulled out the most tiniest cat from the bush. She immediately curled up in my arms. I took her in and she's been with me ever since! She is very playful and affectionate cat. She likes chicken. </p>
